# üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è DAKOSYS - Docker App Kometa Overlay System

DAKOSYS is a powerful tool for Plex users that creates and manages Trakt.tv lists and Kometa/PMM overlays. It helps you categorize anime episodes by type, track TV show statuses, display media file sizes, all running in Docker with automatic scheduling.

### üîî Notifications System

- Discord webhook integration

### üìã Requirements

- Plex Media Server

- Trakt.tv account

- Trakt.tv API application

- Docker and Docker Compose

- Kometa/PMM (Plex Meta Manager)
  
## üê≥ Quick Start
1. Create directories for config and data

```
mkdir -p dakosys/{config,data}
cd dakosys
```
2. Download the docker-compose.yml file

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahara101/dakosys/main/docker-compose.yml
```
3. Run the setup command
   
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys setup
```
This will guide you through creating a configuration file with options for all services.

4. Start the auto-updater daemon
```
docker compose up -d dakosys-updater
```
This starts the background service that automatically runs updates according to your schedule.

## üß© Service Configuration

During setup, you can enable three main services:

1. Anime Episode Type Tracker
Categorizes anime episodes by type (filler, manga canon, etc.), creates Trakt lists and Kometa overlays.

<div align="center">
  <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è TRAKT VIP REQUIRED ‚ö†Ô∏è</h2>
  <p>Trakt free accounts are limited to 2-10 lists.<br>
  This app creates multiple lists (1 per episode type per anime).<br></p>
</div>

Since this cannot be fully automated because of differences in Anime Filler List and Trakt names I have added several commands for this service, see below. 

The other two services are set and forget :)

2. TV/Anime Status Tracker
Creates overlays showing airing status, next episode dates, and special episodes.

3. Size Overlay Service
Creates overlays displaying file sizes and episode counts.

Each service can be configured separately with different libraries and schedules.
## üìù Usage Examples

You can always run ```docker compose run --rm dakosys --help``` to see possible commands, and then ```--help``` on each command to check how it is used. 

### Anime Episode Type Tracker

Create all list types for an anime at once

You can type either the Plex anime name or the Anime Filler List (AFL) name (from URL). For Example https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations whereas ```boruto-naruto-next-generations``` is the name you need. 

The command below will first try to find the name in Plex. If it is a direct copy from Plex it will match it directly, if not it will try to find it. Then, it tries to match the Plex name to AFL. It uses a matching logic and asks if the found anime is the correct one. Please read the outputs. See an example at the end of README. 

```
docker compose run --rm dakosys create-all "One-Piece"
```

Create a list of filler episodes
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys create-list "Naruto-Shiuden" FILLER
```

Fix mapping errors for episodes
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys fix-mappings
```

List all available anime on Anime Filler List
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys list-anime
```

Show all episodes with their types
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys show-episodes "Demon Slayer Kimetsu No Yaiba"
```

Delete a list
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys delete-list bleach FILLER
```

Delere more lists at once
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys list-lists --format plain --anime "One Punch Man" | xargs -n2 docker compose run --rm --no-TTY dakosys delete-piped --force
```

### Managing Scheduled Updates

Add an anime to automatic updates
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys schedule add "Jujutsu Kaisen"
```

Remove an anime from automatic updates
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys schedule remove "Dragon Ball"
```

List all automatically updated anime
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys schedule list
```

Run an immediate update of all services
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys run-update all
```

Run an immediate update of a specific service
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys run-update tv_status_tracker
```
### List Management
List all Trakt lists created by DAKOSYS
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys list-lists
```

List all Trakt lists for a specific anime
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys list-lists --anime "Attack on Titan"
```

Manually synchronize collections file
This command will sync the Kometa collections file with all generated trakt lists. Useful in case the file gets deleted/altered.
```
docker compose run --rm dakosys sync-collections
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scheduler Configuration
You can configure when updates run by editing the scheduler section in your config.yaml file. Each service can have its own schedule:
```
  anime_episode_type:
    type: "daily"
    times: ["03:00"]
  
  tv_status_tracker:
    type: "hourly"
    minute: 30
  
  size_overlay:
    type: "weekly"
    days: ["sunday"]
    time: "04:00"
```
Available schedule types:

hourly: Run every hour at the specified minute

daily: Run every day at specified times

weekly: Run on specified days of the week at a set time

monthly: Run on specified dates of the month at a set time
